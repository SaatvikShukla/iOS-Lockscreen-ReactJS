# Getting Started
To run the project locally, please follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ``` 
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ios-web-implementation.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in the project's root directory:
   ``` 
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server by running the command:
   ``` 
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   This will compile the project and launch a local server. You can access the web implementation of iOS by opening your browser and navigating to ```http://localhost:5173``` (or the specified port, if changed).
 
# Building the project
If you want to build the project for production, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command in the project's root directory:
   ``` 
   npm run build
   ```
   This will generate the optimized and minified version of the project in the dist or build directory.
   
2. You can then deploy the generated files to a web server of your choice or host them using a service like GitHub Pages or Firebase Hosting.
